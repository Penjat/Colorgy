# Colorgy
psychedelic color matching puzzle game 

  Colorgy is a puzzle game I developed and released in 2018.  The player uses different tools or runes to attempt to clear away all the tiles on the game board.  The runes can clear tiles or add color to them or take color from them or even switch colors to their opposite.  

  When the game loads, the levels will modualte both in positioning and in color.  In terms of position, this means that a level can be flipped upsidedown, right-to-left, or both.  In terms of color, the tiles will randomly shift along the color wheel. A level with Red and Orange tiles may shift over to Blue and Purple or Yellow and Green respectively.  The colors can also flip to so the previous puzzle would be Red and Purple , Blue and Green , or Yellow and Orange.  This means that every signal puzzle has 24 possible unique orientations.
  The Reasoning for this modualation was to add replay value and to prevent the player from simple memorizing the moves required to complete a puzzle.  This was also also very useful durring the development process as it allowed me to better gauge how difficult the puzzle was; even if I knew the anwser, I would still have to take some time and think about it.

  The music for Colorgy presented a unique challange.  I reasoned that any sort of repetative music loop, even if it was well composed, would be distracting and potentially take away from the gameplay experince.  A person playing a game of chess, for example, doesn't want anything taking their attention away from the game.  
   So I wanted music that reacted dynamically to what is going on in the game.  What I ended up doing is assigning a certain chord to each type of rune in the game.  Major for a normal rune, Augmented for a cube rune, and sus4 for a Diamond.  As the level progresses, the voicing for the chords get higher and higher in register.
