# Colorgy
psychedelic color matching puzzle game 

Colorgy is a puzzle game I developed and released in 2018.  The player uses different tools or runes to attempt to clear away all the tiles on the game board.  The runes can clear tiles or add color to them or take color from them or even switch colors to their opposite.  

When the game loads, the levels will modualte both in positioning and in color.  In terms of position, this means that a level can be flipped upsidedown, right-to-left, or both.  In terms of color, the tiles will randomly shift along the color wheel. A level with Red and Orange tiles may shift over to Blue and Purple or Yellow and Green respectively.  The colors can also flip to so the previous puzzle would be Red and Purple , Blue and Green , or Yellow and Orange.
